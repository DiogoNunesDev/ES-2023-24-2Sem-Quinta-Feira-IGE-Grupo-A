/**
 * LandingPage component for the React application.
 * This component serves as the initial view or "landing page" of the application, providing navigation to other parts of the app.
 * 
 * The component consists of a top-level 'div' element, within which there are two main elements:
 *   1. A 'div' element displaying the text "LandingPage", serving as a title or header for this view.
 *   2. A 'Link' component from react-router-dom, which provides a link to the "dashboard" route. This serves as the navigation element to the Dashboard page of the application.
 * 
 * This structure and design can be expanded and styled further according to the application's needs.
 * 
 * @returns {JSX.Element} - The rendered LandingPage component.
